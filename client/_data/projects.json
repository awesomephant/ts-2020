So I decided to design my own personal typeface by using my 'happysad' doodles to create an abstract shape which would end up in each of the letters. The idea was to create a playful typeface by using contrast between positive and negative spaces: the outside of each letter is made with very simple shapes but inside, the abstract shape is here to bring some more fun to the typeface. We can even find smilies in some letters but they are simply suggested.",

However, printing this script in movable type requires heavy simplification of this aesthetic tradition.\nIt tends to lose its rhythm, fluidity and hence artistic quality within a homogenised type system. For Typographic Singularity, I draw inspiration from Nasta‘līq and its ’aesthetic qualities in an ode to  calligraphers who continue to work their magic, striving to keep the tradition of the script alive with the purpose of its preservation in a modern digital age.

My project has begun with this methodology of Dr Frankenstein to create a new creature which looks like a human but not a perfect human.\nI have been working on the subject Frankenstein, inspired by Dr Frankenstein’s methodology on making an entirely new human look-alike creature by combining dead bodies collected from charnel houses. I found it interesting with the character of Frankenstein’s creature as an incomplete entity made by broken pieces of completeness. Frankenstein’s creature is not a natural creation of life, but a creation that did not turn out as expected. Dr Frankenstein thought that he had attached the whole human body to create complete life, and though\nhe (the creature) actually had a body that could think and even excels like a human being, Frankenstein’s creature regarded himself as an incomplete and miserable one.\nFrom this idea of complete incompleteness of Frankenstein’s creature, I have been made a few Frankenstein inspired typeface series for few years, which is made by collecting and combining free fonts over the website, with all the different typefaces in every single stroke with the methodology of Dr Frankenstein. As a continuing project of the Frankenstein series, I am experimenting to create a variable font, which can be partially divided and adjustable for each stroke.With 27 buttons of English keyboard, I made 27 units for the combinable, stackable stroke structure to build up complete one letter(or any kind of symbol).\nAs shape and weight are adjustable for each unit, the whole sentence can be animated separately like it’s alive or it can be adjusted all together for a more refined look for display.",

    "description": "One of the nice things about Tokyo is that there are vending machines on almost every corner. This is especially useful if you visit the city in the summer as I did in 2016. As a foreigner you have to somehow make a choice of which of these unfamiliar brands will best quench your thirst. Maybe you can’t read the characters of the language so you need to make the decision based on different criteria than you would at home.\nI found making this decision pretty easy. When looking at the available choices there was a drink called Pocari Sweat. The name sounds quite unappealing, but intriguing, a sweaty drink. Its packaging instantly stood out amongst the others. The can was a single shade of blue with a white swoosh, with the name vertically set in modern type. It seemed very clear. This is Pocari Sweat. The other drinks had decorations and illustrations that wanted to tell me something about their ingredients or tastes. I had no idea what Pocari Sweat was or how it would it taste. I choose the sweaty drink each time I used a vending machine during for the rest of the trip, this becoming an important part of my visit to Japan.\nMuch later I discovered that German designer Helmut Schmidt was responsible for the brand identity. I was pretty excited by this having been a fan of his work for a while. I think this says something about how design and typography communicate. Being spoken to by Schmidt across time and space in a completely different context to how I had previously experienced his work in history of design books.",
