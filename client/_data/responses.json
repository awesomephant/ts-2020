    "text": "Melting Time\nDuring the period of the pandemic things feel a bit different. Time seems to have stopped even if it is still rolling. Your body is stuck in a room but your mind is still travelling around. Feeling a bit lonely but at the same time “surrounded by yourself”. An inner self endoscopy. Exploring the actual value of life, learning how to appreciate simple things that were taken as granted even if there are not. Traveling through a nostalgic dream of the past and some hope for the future. From the “robotic” past to the adjustable present. Time feels like melting.",

    "text": "This image, is one that I've been contemplating for the last few months. It's a plate from \"Communes in the New World\", a book published in 1972, written by Liselotte and O.M. Ungers. The project was a broad sociological and architectural study of communal societies in America, from the 'founding' (in the white colonial sense) of the USA to the hippie movements of the 1970's. The yin-yang describes the beliefs which scaffolded most of those communities: a return to the balance between nature and man, and equality between all individuals.\nToday, with much of the world literally and figuratively on fire, it feels important for me to share this image and consider the future it proposes. How, in this time of isolation and distance, can we become united in our purpose? How can this image can be transformed, made real? And, if another world is truly possible, what are we willing to do and risk, personally, professionally, to achieve this future?",

Instead I've chosen to extract something from a text which I'm working with, which I think speaks to the themes of the show, and I wrote a small piece of writing to further explain it. I added a close crop of the image, because I think it might be nice to zoom in and see some more detail. I would request you either show both images, or just \"RCA_YinYang_01.jpg\" if you can only use one image.\" Images:"

    "text": "Typefaces and vernacular lettering convey a sense of ‘everyday’ familiarity through the recognisable commonalities of their forms, and their common use and reuse can cause them to trigger unexpected associations, feelings or memories. These consequences reverberate through the different contexts in which they appear, contributing layers of meaning which multiply through each encounter–both in the work of their creators and through their appropriation by others. As visual practitioners and type designers, we engage with both the accumulation and the creation of graphic readymades in our physical, virtual, literal and metaphorical movements through the environments of everyday life.",
